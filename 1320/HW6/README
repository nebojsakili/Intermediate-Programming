C files included: main.c, stack_queue.c, hw6.c, stack_queue.h, hw6.h

--------

main.c runs both the prompts
stack_queue.c hold all of the stack and queue function definitions
hw6.c holds all of the prompt functions

--------

Compilation instructions:

gcc main.c stack_queue.c hw6.c -o prompt
./prompt

(Note: a makefile exists, but my lap top is not configured to compile make files, so it may not work properly)

There is a question in main asking which prompt to perform. 1 or 2 are valid choices


--------

In prompt 1, the tip jar will only pop up to two times, meaning the wage earned should not be
bigger than the last two tip entries combined

-The menu in prompt one takes 1, 2 or 3 as valid choices


---------

In prompt 2, please make sure to have the customers.txt file present in the working directory, since the filename is hardcoded
